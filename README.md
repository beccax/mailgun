[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/nilenso/mailgun.svg)](https://clojars.org/nilenso/mailgun)

A Clojure mailgun API.

## Leiningen
```clj
[nilenso/mailgun "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Usage
```clj
(:require [mailgun.mail :as mail])
```

The `send-mail` function takes two argument mailgun credentials and email content which has to be given in the following format
```clj
(def creds {:key "key-3ax6xnjp29jd6fds4gc373sgvjxteol1" :domain "bar.com"})

(def content {:from "no-reply@bar.com"
              :to "someone@foo.com"
              :subject "Test"
              :html "test body"
              :attachment [(clojure.java.io/file "/path/to/file1.doc")
                           (clojure.java.io/file "/path/to/file2.doc")]})
```
The value of the `:attachment` has to be a vector of files to be attached. If there are no files to be attached then don't include the `:attachment` keyword in the content.

To send the email
```clj
(mail/send-mail creds content)
```
